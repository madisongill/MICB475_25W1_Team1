# Feb 24 Team Meeting Agenda


## What we completed on our project:

* Finished our team proposal and handed it in to Canvas
* Created a rough timeline for when we want to complete each part of the project
* Everyone is on board with the project and has the necessary foundational knowledge on multiple sclerosis (MS)


## Goal/Next Steps:

1. To start the analysis as soon as possible. When we receive feedback on the team proposal incorporate into our pipeline/workflow
2. Next part of analysis is to start Aim 1 which is evaluating the alpha diversity of the three different MS subtypes (RRMS, SPMS, PPMS) and comparing sex within these subtypes using Shannon index and Faith's phylogenetic diversity. Goal: To assess differences in richness, evenness, and phylogenetic diversity between male and female patients within each MS subtype.
3. Before we begin Aim 1 hoping to receive advice or any comments regarding the proposed workflow.
