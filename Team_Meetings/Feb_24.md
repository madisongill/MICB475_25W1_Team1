# Feb 24 Team Meeting Agenda


## What we completed on our project:

* Finished our team proposal and handed it in to Canvas
* Created a rough timeline for when we want to complete each part of the project
* Everyone is on board with the project and has the necessary foundational knowledge on multiple sclerosis (MS)


## Goal/Next Steps:

1. To start the analysis as soon as possible. When we receive feedback on the team proposal incorporate into our pipeline/workflow
2. Next part of analysis is to start Aim 1 which is evaluating the alpha diversity of the three different MS subtypes (RRMS, SPMS, PPMS) and comparing sex within these subtypes using Shannon index and Faith's phylogenetic diversity. Goal: To assess differences in richness, evenness, and phylogenetic diversity between male and female patients within each MS subtype.
3. Before we begin Aim 1 hoping to receive advice or any comments regarding the proposed workflow.


## Notes from meeting

* MS subtype not included in title, helpful to mention more about different subtypes in title and introduction
* Separate female and male in healthy group
* If one group has no significant differences can still do aim 2 would just involve more work
* DON'T FORGET TO GLOM TO SAME LEVEL (ex: phylum, genus)
* CoreMicrobiome use analysis website and decide from there what level to glom to do
* Aims are great feedback 
* CoreMicrobiome not performing any specific stats included in package
* Should start analysis now!!
