# Feb 3, 2026 Meeting Agenda

## 1. Potential Research Topics

1) Multiple Sclerosis Dataset (MS)
Variables interested in: Gender, Method of birth, Allergies if a specific allergen type is more likely to develop MS?


Research Question: Compare gender differences of microbiome of: (1) non-MS patients and MS patients, (2) female MS patients and male MS patients


Previous literature:
There have been strong links in gender differences in MS patients:  
* Men diagnosed with MS seem to progress cognitively in symptoms more rapidly
* Women are more likely to be diagnosed with MS
* Observed sex bias in symptoms, diagnosis of MS, disease progression
